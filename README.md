This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.

This is a Cost Breakdown Calculator much like the SplitWise Application.
This application uses Ember and multiple helpers to determine the average price based on the users input.
From that input it is determined how much each person owes. Tests have been conucted, tab index is up to date, and aria labeling has been added.
